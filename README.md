# NODEMCU-PROJECTS
The NodeMCU IoT project uses Wi-Fi-enabled ESP8266 to control and monitor devices remotely. It supports real-time data collection from sensors, device automation via mobile apps, and cloud integration with platforms like Blynk or ThingSpeak, enabling smart home, weather, or industrial applications.
